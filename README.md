# SpaceMovementVRExplorations

Working on creating spatial environments in 3D that affect the experience of moving in that environment. 
I am working in Unity 2020.3.31f1 right now (Sept 19, 2022)

This seems to be a focus on volumes and physics. I decided to start with water/ swimming.

I first tried this tutorial: https://youtu.be/K8lOEmdZ78o
One issue I had is that if a box is sunken into a plane, it does not have the same trigger effect (of being able to walk through it), so the water script never kicked in. 

I am reading these tutorials now to better understand swimming and physics involved: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/movement/swimming/
And am interested in reading the rest of them on movement as well: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/movement/

This swimming tutorial focuses on the physics of being in water such as drag and buyoncy, as well as challenges of climbing and jumping. It also mentions "water volumes that move in their entirety because they're animated", where there is another body (of water) to manage. It is also possible to add objects to interact with that respond to player in ways that the water would dictate as well.
