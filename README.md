# SpaceMovementVRExplorations

Working on creating spatial environments in 3D that affect the experience of moving in that environment. 
I am working in Unity 2020.3.31f1 right now (Sept 19, 2022)

This seems to be a focus on volumes and physics. I decided to start with water/ swimming.

I first tried this tutorial: https://youtu.be/K8lOEmdZ78o
One issue I had is that if a box is sunken into a plane, it does not have the same trigger effect (of being able to walk through it), so the water script never kicked in. 

I am reading these tutorials now to better understand swimming and physics involved: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/movement/swimming/
And am interested in reading the rest of them on movement as well: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/movement/
